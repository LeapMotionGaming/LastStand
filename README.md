Game: Top Down Alien Shooter

Summary:
This game was made in Java and is just a simple top down shooter. 
You control a spaceship that travels on an X&Y axis across the screen shooting aliens that come at you from the
side of the screen. Think of Galaga, except sideways and the aliens move across the screen. heh.

Feel free to fork this as needed, just remember to give credit where credit is due.
